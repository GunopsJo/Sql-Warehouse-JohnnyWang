Hi, this is Johnny.
This is a project about DATA Warehouse in SQL. We have three different layers to build the warehouse. They are bronze layer, silver layer, and gold layer. The raw data are from CRM and ERP, and we use them to do data analysis. This project is completed following the tutorial taught by Baraa, a senior data architect in Mercedes-benz.
