Hi, this is Johnny.
This is a project about DATA Warehouse in SQL. We have three different layers to build the warehouse. They are bronze layer, silver layer, and gold layer. The raw data are from CRM and ERP, and we use them to do data analysis. This project is completed following the tutorial taught by Baraa, a senior data architect in Mercedes-benz.


Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)
Objective
Develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

Specifications
Data Sources: Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.

Data Quality: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis.

Integration: Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.

Scope: Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required.

Documentation: Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.
